# barcode-fun

Automation is hard, barcodes are simple. They are designed for workers in repetetive low-skill jobs to increase productivity.

CD2 is attempting to leverage more barcodes in our internal systems, and enable barcode usage in our software to save manual-input tasks, reduce training time, and increase consistency. This will also help us to assist some of our longer-term and growing accounts.

This repository exists to house barcode related resources for CD2.
